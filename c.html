    <h2>C Programming</h2>
    <p>It is a very powerful and general-purpose language used in programming. We can use C to develop software such as
        databases, operating systems, compilers, and many more. This programming language is excellent to learn for
        beginners in programming.</p>

    <h2>About C Programming</h2>
    <p>The C language is imperative, procedural, and general-purpose in nature, developed by Dennis M. Ritchie in 1972
        at
        the Bell Telephone for developing the UNIX OS. As of now, the C language is one of the most widely used computer
        languages along with Java, which is mostly used among modern programmers.</p>


    <h2>Prerequisites of using the C Language</h2>
    <p>Before you proceed ahead with the understanding and learning of the C language, you must have a basic grasp of
        the
        terminologies of computer programming. If you understand the basics of any computer programming language, then
        you
        will be able to effectively understand the C language.</p>

       <h2>Why Learn C Programming Language?</h2>
    <p>language is a must for those working professionals as well as students who want to become established software
    engineers. Here are some of the key reasons why you must learn the C language for the domain of software
    development:</p>
<ul style="color:aliceblue;">
    <li>
        This language helps users comprehend a computerâ€™s internal architecture. It assists you in knowing how a computer
    </li>
    <li>
        would store information within and retrieve it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Learning other programming languages becomes easier after learning C, such as Python, Java, etc.
    </li>    
</ul>
   <p> A programmer who is well-versed with the C language gets opportunities to work on various open-source projects. For
    instance, some of the very popular projects (open-source) have been written using the C programming language, such
    as Python interpreter, Linux kernel, SQLite database, and many more.</p>
