    <h2> What is Java?</h2>
    <p>Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser
        implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development. Java is fast, secure, and
        reliable, therefore. It is widely used for developing Java applications in laptops, data centers, game consoles,
        scientific supercomputers, cell phones, etc.</p>

    <h2> What is Java Platform?</h2>
    <p>Java Platform is a collection of programs that help programmers to develop and run Java programming applications
        efficiently. It includes an execution engine, a compiler, and a set of libraries in it. It is a set of computer
        software and specifications. James Gosling developed the Java platform at Sun Microsystems, and the Oracle
        Corporation later acquired it.</p>

    <h2>What is JVM?</h2>
    <p>Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a engine that provides runtime environment to drive the Java Code or applications. It
    converts Java bytecode into machines language. JVM is a part of Java Runtime Environment (JRE). In other programming
    languages, the compiler produces machine code for a particular system. However, Java compiler produces code for a
    Virtual Machine known as Java Virtual Machine.</p>

    <h2>How JVM Works?</h2>
    <p>First, Java code is compiled into bytecode. This bytecode gets interpreted on different machines

    Between host system and Java source, Bytecode is an intermediary language.

    JVM in Java is responsible for allocating memory space.</p>
