    <h2>What is JavaScript.</h2>
    <p><b>JavaScript is Everywhere.</b> Millions of web pages are built on JavaScript and it’s not going anywhere at
        least for
        now. On one side HTML and CSS give styling to the web pages but on the other side, it’s the magic of JavaScript
        that
        makes your web page alive. Today this language is not just limited to your web browser. You can also use it for
        server-side applications. Isn’t it cool to use a single language for both client-side and server-side
        applications?
        A single language fulfills both of the purposes and this is the main reason TON of job posting is there for
        javascript developers in the tech industry.</p>

    <p2 style="color: rgb(152, 152, 152);">According to Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019, JavaScript is the #1
        programming language. The language is widely
        used by 95% of all the websites Whether it’s a small startup or a big company, most of them are working on some
        kind
        of website or an app that requires a good knowledge of this language. A lot of frameworks and libraries are
        there
        for javascript. These frameworks and libraries can be easily learned if your javascript fundamentals are clear.
        A
        lot of concepts are confusing and overwhelming for developers but a good knowledge of these concepts will help
        you
        in the long run. Frameworks and libraries come and go but the fundamentals always remain the same. It’s easy to
        build any kind of application and learn any framework and libraries if the fundamentals are clear. Also, it will
        help you in interviews as well. Let’s discuss some of the basic concepts of javascript which are important to
        learn
        for any JavaScript developer. Become a good front-end developer with Geeksforgeeks JavaScript Foundation – Self
        Paced and learn all the aspects of web development with ease.</p2>


    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>Scope means variable access. What variable do I have access to when a code is running? In Javascript by default,
    you’re always in root scope i.e. the window scope. The scope is simply a box with a boundary for variables,
    functions, and objects. These boundaries put restrictions on variables and determine whether you have access to the
    variable or not. It limits the visibility or availability of a variable to the other parts of the code. You must
    have a clear understanding of this concept because it helps you to separate logic in your code and also improves the
    readability. A scope can be defined in two ways –</p>

<ol style="color: white;"> 
    <li>
        Local Scope allows access to everything within the boundaries (inside the box)
    </li>
    <li>
        Global Scope is everything outside the boundaries (outside the box). A global scope can not access a variable
        defined in local scope because it is enclosed from the outer world, except if you return it.
    </li>
</ol>
